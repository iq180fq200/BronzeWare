Logical Hebrew ??\n//\n// Both \"ISO\" charsets use a completely identical set of code points, whereas\n// \"windows-1255\" and \"x-mac-hebrew\" are two different proper supersets of\n// these code points. windows-1255 defines additional characters in the range\n// 0x80-0x9F as some misc punctuation marks as well as some Hebrew-specific\n// diacritics and additional 'Yiddish' ligature letters in the range 0xc0-0xd6.\n// x-mac-hebrew defines similar additional code points but with a different\n// mapping.\n//\n// As far as an average Hebrew text with no diacritics is concerned, all four\n// charsets are identical with respect to code points. Meaning that for the\n// main Hebrew alphabet, all four map the same values to all 27 Hebrew letters\n// (including final letters).\n//\n// The dominant difference between these charsets is their directionality.\n// \"Visual\" directionality means that the text is ordered as if the renderer is\n// not aware of a BIDI rendering algorithm. The renderer sees the text and\n// draws it from left to right. The text itself when ordered naturally is read\n// backwards. A buffer of Visual Hebrew generally looks like so:\n// \"[last word of first line spelled backwards] [whole line ordered backwards\n// and spelled backwards] [first word of first line spelled backwards]\n// [end of line] [last word of second line] ... etc' \"\n// adding punctuation marks, numbers and English text to visual text is\n// naturally also \"visual\" and from left to right.\n//\n// \"Logical\" directionality means the text is ordered \"naturally\" according to\n// the order it is read. It is the responsibility of the renderer to display\n// the text from right to left. A BIDI algorithm is used to place general\n// punctuation marks, numbers and English text in the text.\n//\n// Texts in x-mac-hebrew are almost impossible to find on the Internet. From\n// what little evidence I could find, it seems that its general directionality\n// is Logical.\n//\n// To sum up all of the above, the Hebrew probing mechanism knows about two\n// charsets:\n// Visual Hebrew - \"ISO-8859-8\" - backwards text - Words and sentences are\n//    backwards while line order is natural. For charset recognition purposes\n//    the line order is unimportant (In fact, for this implementation, even\n//    word order is unimportant).\n// Logical Hebrew - \"windows-1255\" - normal, naturally ordered text.\n//\n// \"ISO-8859-8-I\" is a subset of windows-1255 and doesn't need to be\n//    specifically identified.\n// \"x-mac-hebrew\" is also identified as windows-1255. A text in x-mac-hebrew\n//    that contain special punctuation marks or diacritics is displayed with\n//    some unconverted characters showing as question marks. This problem might\n//    be corrected using another model prober for x-mac-hebrew. Due to the fact\n//    that x-mac-hebrew texts are so rare, writing another model prober isn't\n//    worth the effort and performance hit.\n//\n//////// The Prober ////////\n//\n// The prober is divided between two SBCharSetProbers and a HebrewProber,\n// all of which are managed, created, fed data, inquired and deleted by the\n// SBCSGroupProber. The two SBCharSetProbers identify that the text is in\n// fact some kind of Hebrew, Logical or Visual. The final decision about which\n// one is it is made by the HebrewProber by combining final-letter scores\n// with the scores of the two SBCharSetProbers to produce a final answer.\n//\n// The SBCSGroupProber is responsible for stripping the original text of HTML\n// tags, English characters, numbers, low-ASCII punctuation characters, spaces\n// and new lines. It reduces any sequence of such characters to a single space.\n// The buffer fed to each prober in the SBCS group prober is pure text in\n// high-ASCII.\n// The two SBCharSetProbers (model probers) share the same language model:\n// Win1255Model.\n// The first SBCharSetProber uses the model normally as any other\n// SBCharSetProber does, to recognize windows-1255, upon which this model was\n// built. The second SBCharSetProber is told to make the pair-of-letter\n// lookup in the language model backwards. This in practice exactly simulates\n// a visual Hebrew model using the windows-1255 logical Hebrew model.\n//\n// The HebrewProber is not using any language model. All it does is look for\n// final-letter evidence suggesting the text is either logical Hebrew or visual\n// Hebrew. Disjointed from the model probers, the results of the HebrewProber\n// alone are meaningless. HebrewProber always returns 0.00 as confidence\n// since it never identifies a charset by itself. Instead, the pointer to the\n// HebrewProber is passed to the model probers as a helper \"Name Prober\".\n// When the Group prober receives a positive identification from any prober,\n// it asks for the name of the charset identified. If the prober queried is a\n// Hebrew model prober, the model prober forwards the call to the\n// HebrewProber to make the final decision. In the HebrewProber, the\n// decision is made according to the final-letters scores maintained and Both\n// model probers scores. The answer is returned in the form of the name of the\n// charset identified, either \"windows-1255\" or \"ISO-8859-8\".\nvar CharSetProber = require('./charsetprober');\n\nvar constants = require('./constants'); // https://developer.mozilla.org/En/Core_JavaScript_1.5_Reference/Objects/Array/IndexOf\n\n\nif (!Array.prototype.indexOf) {\n  Array.prototype.indexOf = function (elt\n  /*, from*/\n  ) {\n    var len = this.length >>> 0;\n    var from = Number(arguments[1]) || 0;\n    from = from < 0 ?

Logical Hebrew ??\n//\n// Both \"ISO\" charsets use a completely identical set of code points, whereas\n// \"windows-1255\" and \"x-mac-hebrew\" are two different proper supersets of\n// these code points. windows-1255 defines additional characters in the range\n// 0x80-0x9F as some misc punctuation marks as well as some Hebrew-specific\n// diacritics and additional 'Yiddish' ligature letters in the range 0xc0-0xd6.\n// x-mac-hebrew defines similar additional code points but with a different\n// mapping.\n//\n// As far as an average Hebrew text with no diacritics is concerned, all four\n// charsets are identical with respect to code points. Meaning that for the\n// main Hebrew alphabet, all four map the same values to all 27 Hebrew letters\n// (including final letters).\n//\n// The dominant difference between these charsets is their directionality.\n// \"Visual\" directionality means that the text is ordered as if the renderer is\n// not aware of a BIDI rendering algorithm. The renderer sees the text and\n// draws it from left to right. The text itself when ordered naturally is read\n// backwards. A buffer of Visual Hebrew generally looks like so:\n// \"[last word of first line spelled backwards] [whole line ordered backwards\n// and spelled backwards] [first word of first line spelled backwards]\n// [end of line] [last word of second line] ... etc' \"\n// adding punctuation marks, numbers and English text to visual text is\n// naturally also \"visual\" and from left to right.\n//\n// \"Logical\" directionality means the text is ordered \"naturally\" according to\n// the order it is read. It is the responsibility of the renderer to display\n// the text from right to left. A BIDI algorithm is used to place general\n// punctuation marks, numbers and English text in the text.\n//\n// Texts in x-mac-hebrew are almost impossible to find on the Internet. From\n// what little evidence I could find, it seems that its general directionality\n// is Logical.\n//\n// To sum up all of the above, the Hebrew probing mechanism knows about two\n// charsets:\n// Visual Hebrew - \"ISO-8859-8\" - backwards text - Words and sentences are\n//    backwards while line order is natural. For charset recognition purposes\n//    the line order is unimportant (In fact, for this implementation, even\n//    word order is unimportant).\n// Logical Hebrew - \"windows-1255\" - normal, naturally ordered text.\n//\n// \"ISO-8859-8-I\" is a subset of windows-1255 and doesn't need to be\n//    specifically identified.\n// \"x-mac-hebrew\" is also identified as windows-1255. A text in x-mac-hebrew\n//    that contain special punctuation marks or diacritics is displayed with\n//    some unconverted characters showing as question marks. This problem might\n//    be corrected using another model prober for x-mac-hebrew. Due to the fact\n//    that x-mac-hebrew texts are so rare, writing another model prober isn't\n//    worth the effort and performance hit.\n//\n//////// The Prober ////////\n//\n// The prober is divided between two SBCharSetProbers and a HebrewProber,\n// all of which are managed, created, fed data, inquired and deleted by the\n// SBCSGroupProber. The two SBCharSetProbers identify that the text is in\n// fact some kind of Hebrew, Logical or Visual. The final decision about which\n// one is it is made by the HebrewProber by combining final-letter scores\n// with the scores of the two SBCharSetProbers to produce a final answer.\n//\n// The SBCSGroupProber is responsible for stripping the original text of HTML\n// tags, English characters, numbers, low-ASCII punctuation characters, spaces\n// and new lines. It reduces any sequence of such characters to a single space.\n// The buffer fed to each prober in the SBCS group prober is pure text in\n// high-ASCII.\n// The two SBCharSetProbers (model probers) share the same language model:\n// Win1255Model.\n// The first SBCharSetProber uses the model normally as any other\n// SBCharSetProber does, to recognize windows-1255, upon which this model was\n// built. The second SBCharSetProber is told to make the pair-of-letter\n// lookup in the language model backwards. This in practice exactly simulates\n// a visual Hebrew model using the windows-1255 logical Hebrew model.\n//\n// The HebrewProber is not using any language model. All it does is look for\n// final-letter evidence suggesting the text is either logical Hebrew or visual\n// Hebrew. Disjointed from the model probers, the results of the HebrewProber\n// alone are meaningless. HebrewProber always returns 0.00 as confidence\n// since it never identifies a charset by itself. Instead, the pointer to the\n// HebrewProber is passed to the model probers as a helper \"Name Prober\".\n// When the Group prober receives a positive identification from any prober,\n// it asks for the name of the charset identified. If the prober queried is a\n// Hebrew model prober, the model prober forwards the call to the\n// HebrewProber to make the final decision. In the HebrewProber, the\n// decision is made according to the final-letters scores maintained and Both\n// model probers scores. The answer is returned in the form of the name of the\n// charset identified, either \"windows-1255\" or \"ISO-8859-8\".\n\nvar CharSetProber = require('./charsetprober');\nvar constants = require('./constants')\n\n// https://developer.mozilla.org/En/Core_JavaScript_1.5_Reference/Objects/Array/IndexOf\nif (!Array.prototype.indexOf)\n{\n    Array.prototype.indexOf = function(elt /*, from*/)\n    {\n        var len = this.length >>> 0;\n\n        var from = Number(arguments[1]) || 0;\n        from = (from < 0)\n             ?
